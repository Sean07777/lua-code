# Some of Sean's lua scripts.
These are a few scripts that I have decided to post just to show some of my previous work. I have many more scripts that I have made in my time and enjoy scripting.
Good day.

## Included scripts
- A server script that handles token miners. (miners that mine an in-game currency). - You will see this functioning in Pc Clicker Simulator at a building called GrimCoin.
- A local script that allows purchase of these miners by a GUI. - You will see this functioning in Pc Clicker Simulator at a building called GrimCoin.
